@Me is a simple and lightweight messaging application for iOS, written entirely in the Swift programming language. 
Developed by me, myself, and I, the only goal for the application is to provide a reliable, open source communication 
platform to better connect the world. The only dependencies are [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for backend,
[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) to coordinate push notifications, and [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) 
to help with image caching.

## Features

- [x] Impressively fast text and picture messaging
- [x] Customizable profile picture, display name
- [x] Messaging caching to avoid redownloading

## Coming Soon

- [ ] Support for video messaging, gifs and more
- [ ] Ability to respond to message at lockscreen
- [ ] Sharing extension for use with compatible iOS apps
